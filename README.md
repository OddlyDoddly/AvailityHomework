Homework questions
1. One of my proudest professional achievements was getting my first job in the tech industry at NeuroInitiative.
It was a great accomplishment for me because I had been programming since a young age, and it was the first time I was
able to prove my knowledge and skillsets without having professional or college experience to back my application. I proved
that I was competent and capable in the technical industry through conversation and interviews.

2. A recent book I've read that I really liked was "The Phenomenology of Mind" by Hegel. I recommend this book because it teaches
you a lot about the abstract of the human mind which helped me learn a lot about how I work and how others worked. Hegel
does an amazing job at explaining philosophy in plain english. I think philosophy is very helpful in everyday life and believe
everyone could benefit from reading a bit of philosophy.

3. Availity is a company that helps doctors get money out of insurance companies for patients who need it. We write computer programs
that allow doctors to request information from insurance companies, and allows them to make requests to get the money they need when they need it.
